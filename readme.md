Hey,
I couldn't merge our code in the traditional way because of some files you added to the commit.
Dont worry about it, I got your code and embedded it into my project.
You'll be able to see the post view you made in the "Feed" tab. It may take a minute to load (at least it does in school) because of wifi or something. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the layout of the code, and let me know in class tomorrow if you need help getting everything to work.
Worst comes to worst, if you dont want to wait to work on the project, you can start over (not literally) since you put all of your code on github and the up to date code is on github, you can do the following
- Delete everything in your project directory
- Then you can do one of two things
  - In the command line, in that directory (using "cd" command), type "git checkout main"
    - then type "git pull"
    - after that you'll have to type "pod update"
  - Or, in a new directory, you can type "git clone https://github.com/devin12422/Fred.git"
Either of these paths should work, shoot me an email if it doesnt at s015516@students.lmsd.org
